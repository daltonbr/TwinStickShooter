[Course link](https://learn.unrealengine.com/course/2814930)

This series will introduce us to the Twin Stick Shooter project. Zak Parrish will walk through creating a primarily Blueprint project, with a small portion of provided C++ code. The course will also have you work through a Blueprint/C++ workflow, showing how easy it is to work with both. Zak will cover the coding framework and how to leverage it to build different parts of the project: building up characters from a Base Class, how to pass damage via Blueprint, and much more. By the end of the course, you will have a working Twin Stick Shooter project and an understanding of all the tools and workflows which go into making it.
